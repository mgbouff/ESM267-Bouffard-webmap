## The Osa Peninsula: Critical Habitat for Endangered Birds

In Latin America, Costa Rica is home to around 840 species of birds, more than the entirety of North America. The area also contains particularly vulnerable species like the yellow-billed Cotinga, one of the rarest and most endangered bird species in Central America used to span Costa Rica and Panama but now only lives in the small area of the Osa Peninsula.

The Osa Peninsula contains tropical forest habitat that is important to both local species and migratory species that rely on the area for wintering and breeding habitat. 

### Threatened Endemic Species

About a dozen of the bird species that live on Costa Rica's southern coast are considered endemic, meaning that they are only found on the Osa Peninsula and nearby areas. Of these, five are considered to be a major concern to conservationists.

-Yellow-billed Cotinga (Carpodectes antoniae)
-Black-cheeked Ant-Tanager (Habia atrimaxillaris)
-Mangrove Hummingbird (Amazilia boucardi)
-Turquoise Cotinga (Cotinga ridgwayi)
-Bairdâ€™s Trogon (Trogon bairdii)

### North American Migratory Breeding birds

The Osa Peninsula is also important habitat for many bird species that migrate all the way from North America. Some of the species that are the most threated by habitat loss in the area include:

-Olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), 
-Wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), 
-Golden-winged warbler (Vermivora chrysoptera), 
-Kentucky warbler (Oporornis formosus), 
-Prothonotary warbler (Protonotaria citrea)

### The Threat of Habitat Loss

All of these species are considered sensitive and have lost a lot of habitat to deforestation. The main driver of deforestation in Costa Rica is land use and land cover change for agriculture. Some crops, such as coffee, teak, and melina can still provide habitat for birds if farmers employ wildlife friendly agricultural practices. But other land uses such as pineapple crops or urban development leave very little wildlife habitat in tact. This is why it is important to analyze land use and land cover change in the Osa Peninsula and monitor how land use decisions impact sensitive species like these threatened birds.

### Mapping Land Use and Wildlife Presence

The map below displays the various ways land is used in the Osa Peninsula. Overlaid on top of the land use categories is presence data for the bird species of conservation concern for the area. The presence data is derived from on-the-ground observaions of individuals from each species. It can be extremely difficult to know where different species live so crowd-sourced presence data from sources like e-bird can help conservationists identify areas that make particulary important habitat for sensitive species. This is helpful because knowing where the most important areas are mean that on-the-ground conservationists, such as those at Osa Conservation, know where to prioritize their resources.
